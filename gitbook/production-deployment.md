# Production Deployment

## Deployment

Due to the insufficiency of something, the services for production are prioritized to use the no-cost services. Including AWS and MongoDB services, these services are on the free-tier operations.

## Frontend Deployment

In the frontend deployment, we use the Vercel ([https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)) web service and Netlify ([https://www.netlify.app/](https://www.netlify.app/)) to deploy the project on production but mainly we use Vercel. For more details, please contact us.
