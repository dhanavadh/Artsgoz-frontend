# Setting up the local

## IDE

We recommend you use Visual Studio Code for your IDE. Please see more info here [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Node

Don't forget to install node.js on your workstation. If not, please see [Setting up your workflow Page](./).

## Open the repo

you can open the project in VS Code by opening Terminal (for macOS) or Command shell (for Windows) then `cd` in your project folder and type `code.` to open the project in VS Code. Then, you can use integrated terminal in the VS Code or your local terminal to run your project on the localhost by typing `npm run dev` . That's all.
